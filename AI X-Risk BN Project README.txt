To run the script you will need a version of the R codebase to open the scripts.
I recommend a recent version (> 3.5), found at https://cran.r-project.org/
You may also find it useful to use R through an IDE. For R in particular I recommend RStudio (found here https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Remaining instructions are contained within the script.
